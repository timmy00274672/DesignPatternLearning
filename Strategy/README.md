In the chapter, I use **cash register** to demo stategy pattern.

I first learn how to use `Swing` with projects in `swing_learning` package.

- `HelloSwing.java`
- `SubmitSwingProgram `: main thread should not invoke Swing
- `SwingConsole`: utility classSw
- `TryButton`: use stategy pattern(FlowLayout), observer patternç

Now, we have enough knowledge to continue this chapter.

1. Scratch the layout
2. Add `CashStrategy` class
