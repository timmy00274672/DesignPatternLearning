In the chapter, I use **cash register** to demo stategy pattern.

I first learn how to use `Swing` with projects in `swing_learning` package.

- `HelloSwing.java`
- `SubmitSwingProgram `: main thread should not invoke Swing
- `SwingConsole`: utility classSw
- `TryButton`: use stategy pattern(FlowLayout), observer pattern√ß

Now, we have enough knowledge to continue this chapter.

I start the first version of cash register in package `cash_register`, and I refer to the book and finish the `cash_registerv2`.

1. Scratch the layout
2. Add `CashStrategy` class

[FIXME] Now the question is that there will be numerous items, and it need flexible codes for modifying each item.
